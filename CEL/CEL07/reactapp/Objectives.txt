Class Exercise Lab

Validating Props.

The props can be validated using prop-types. Need to install the package 
npm install --save prop-types

function Welcome(props) {
    return (
      <p>
        Greetings for the day! I'm {props.name}, a {props.age} years old {props.occupation}.
        Thank you for the Welcome Message!
      </p>
    );
  }
This Welcome component runs perfectly with props are provided or not. 
 <Welcome name="IamNEO"/>
 The above line doesn't provide props for age and occupation. But the react will render the component. This is not the good programmer practise to handle the props.
 Let we see one of the way with prop-types.

The screenshot attached for your reference.
Program:
Create a Welcome component with define PropTypes name, age and occupation. PropTypes is a special property for an component and optional one. 
If you need it you need to install the package. 
npm install --save prop-types

After installation define the props as below.
Welcome.propTypes = {
    name: PropTypes.string.isRequired, // must be a string and defined
    age: PropTypes.number.isRequired, // must be a number and defined
    occupation: PropTypes.string.isRequired  // must be a string and defined
  }; 

From the App Component, render the Welcome component with name "IamNEO". Check the console screen for validating props.

Lab Environment

In the project environment, there are two folders.

a. react - react folder is the read-only folder and has the project's test cases.

b. reactapp – explore your code in this folder. you can use it for coding.

Default settings mapped to run the frontend application in PORT-8081:

The package.json file in reactapp folder is modified as: (Note -If not you can change it as below)

"scripts": {

"start": "PORT=8081 react-scripts start",

"build": "react-scripts build",

"test": "react-scripts test",

"eject": "react-scripts eject"}

 

To run the application:

 

Open the terminal - From Menu bar, select Terminal, then Open Terminal

 

Type the below commands to execute the react project

 

cd reactapp - command to open the folder

 

nvm use 14 - command to select the node version to 14

 

npm install - command to add the packages
[All packages are declared within package.json file]

 

npm start - command to run the application in PORT 8081
